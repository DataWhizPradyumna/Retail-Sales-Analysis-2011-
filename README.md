# 📊 Retail Store Sales Analysis & Visualization

Welcome to this retail sales data analysis project focused on the year 2011. The goal was to help senior leaders—specifically the CEO and CMO—gain actionable insights to make better business decisions.

Starting with a large raw dataset, I carefully cleaned and prepared the data to ensure accuracy and reliability. This included filtering out invalid sales entries, calculating revenue for each transaction, and handling missing customer information to avoid losing valuable sales records.

Using Tableau, I created a series of clear, easy-to-understand visualizations tailored to the specific questions posed by the leadership team:

- 📈 A monthly revenue time series chart that reveals seasonal sales patterns, helping the CEO forecast future trends and plan inventory and marketing efforts effectively.  
- 🌍 Bar charts highlighting the top 10 countries driving the highest revenue and product sales, excluding the United Kingdom as per the CMO’s request, to identify key markets for targeted growth.  
- 👥 A descending bar chart showing the top 10 customers by revenue, enabling the CMO to focus retention efforts on the most valuable clients.  
- 🗺️ A global heatmap illustrating product demand by country, providing the CEO with clear guidance on geographic expansion opportunities.

Alongside these visuals, I developed a concise presentation script that explains the data preparation process and the insights derived, ensuring the findings are communicated clearly and meaningfully to the CEO and CMO.

This project showcases the power of combining thorough data cleaning with effective visualization to transform complex data into actionable business intelligence.
